    <h5 class="box-title">Answer</h5>
    <p>It just so happens that at Braven, we expect the very same things a manager in a job expects of you.</p>
  </div>
  <h4>PROJECTS</h4>
  <p>In the workplace you&rsquo;ll be given projects and deadlines, and then it&rsquo;s up to you to figure out how to manage your time to ensure you meet the deadline. The same is true at Braven.</p>
  <p>Take a look at the syllabus you downloaded earlier for the major projects you will complete throughout the semester. They assess your mastery of the skills you will learn at Braven, but they will also look good in your career portfolio and help you land a career-accelerating opportunity.</p>
  <h4>Grading Rubrics</h4>
  <p>There is no <em>secret</em> to success in the Braven Accelerator; we want to be transparent about what you need to do to succeed. That&rsquo;s why each project will have a rubric to guide how you approach and complete the project.</p>
  <p>Here&rsquo;s an example of a rubric row from the first project, Design Your Career. See the legend below for details.</p>

    <p>That&rsquo;s right - it&rsquo;s smart to reference rubrics quite a lot so that you know the expectations and how to meet them.</p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s also helpful to do so in any job: get clear on what&rsquo;s expected and refer to those expectations as you work.</p>

              <p>Hi Braven Fellows! My name is Jeana, and I'm the head of product at Braven, and I'm really excited to talk to you a little bit about my operating systems and how I stay organized, and I hope it will help you as well.</p>
              <p>It wasn't until college that I figured out my operating systems and, in fact, it wasn't until my sophomore year that I figured out how to make them work for me. My operating systems not only helped me to not drop balls and stay on track with my coursework. It allowed me to look ahead, zoom out and zoom in, and because of that I was able to manage my anxiety, my stress and my energy.</p>
              <p>So I started off every semester with a set of goals and these were things I wanted to achieve in a given semester, and I had to make sure my time spent aligned with those goals. The most helpful tool that I had in college was something provided by my campus career service center, and that was a semester-at-a-glance one-pager. It was literally a one-page template with the three months of the semester on one page and it was blank so that I could go in and jot down my assignments, deadlines, and milestones for the whole semester. It allowed me to get a bird's eye view of everything I needed to accomplish, and it helped me to look ahead. There were times though when I had really big deadlines. For example, a project due at the end of the semester. I chose to break those down into smaller chunks, which I called milestones, and I put those into my semester at a glance view. By a certain time, I might have wanted to get research done and that would be in my semester-at-a-glance calendar.</p>
              <p>Then, I also had a weekly view and a daily view in tandem with this semester view. This sounds like a lot, but it helped me to zoom in and zoom out. The way that the weekly view helped me is it helped me get really clear on what my priorities were for a given week based on my goals for the semester, or what I needed to do in a given class in a semester, and that helped me not get overwhelmed because I didn't have to achieve everything for one class in one week. I could break that down into bite-sized chunks that were manageable and that would help me stay on track and stay focused. And my daily view allowed me to map out my classes, my work schedule, my extracurricular activities, and then I planned my study and my free time around my classes and work schedule to make sure I actually got what I needed to get done done.</p>
              <p>Years later, I operate in the same systems at work. The only difference is now it is on a tech platform. I am not using paper as much as I am using an online operating tool. It's also shared by my team. I use something called Asana. My teammates can also see what I'm working on and my progress towards those things in any given week or month, etc. I've also gotten better at managing the unexpected. I block out time every day and every week (or at least I try to) to plan ahead for the unexpected.</p>
              <p>No matter how good your systems are, you won't get very far without being very sure of your why &mdash; why are you organizing yourself? What are your goals? And how will your organizing systems help you reach your goals? If you can get really clear on that then that will help you to not give up when you feel like your operating system isn't working for you and you don't know why. But it will help you to keep improving, and it will ultimately help you to stay focused. I hope that helped, and I hope you have an awesome semester, Braven Fellows!</p>

            	<p>Hey everyone, my name is Lesley Alegria, and I'm the Program and Operations Manager at Braven. I'm super excited to share more about the operating systems I use to stay organized and make sure that short-term and long-term projects are getting done and make sure I'm always up to date on the things I'm working on.</p>
              <p>So two of the things I used to keep organized are my calendar and Asana, so I'll go head and giveyou a look. So I use Google Calendar to make sure all of my time is allotted to certain projects or to events or to certain things I need to get done. And I use Asana to get into the nitty gritty details of the tasks and projects that I'm working on. On my calendar, I put dates and times for events as well as designate work time to prep for those events. So on my calendar, it serves as a one-stop shop to figure out when and where Lesley is. And so if someone were to look at my calendar, they would know when I was working on certain projects. It is also a great way for myself to stay really organized and know when I need to be working on certain things. Whether it's for an event or checking my inbox or having lunch. All of that is on my calendar. Asana I use to look at the different details of the different projects I'm working on. So for instance, on my calendar, it would say Work Time: work on Story of Self Workshop. But on Asana, it has a certain project that has all of the things I need to be working on so that project comes to life in a successful way. From printing nametags to rehearsing what I'll be saying at the event &mdash; all of that would be on Asana.</p>
              <p>So I use those two systems to keep myself organized to make sure I'm spending my time wisely and making sure I'm being the most productive at all times. It's also a really great way for me to do a pulse check at the end of the month and see where my time was going and how I can restructure my time to be most effective. Hope that helps! If you have any questions about how to use your Google Calendar or Asana, let me know. Happy to chat.</p>

    <p>The #1 killer of personal operating systems is not sticking to them. We've all been there: you set up your action plan and calendar system at the beginning of the semester, but things spin out of control, and you stop using them. Which of the following strategies do you plan to use this semester to avoid this situation?</p>
    <ul class="checklist">
    	<li><input type="checkbox" data-bz-retained="gtd-050" />Take 5 minutes at the end of each day to identify what your most critical work for the next day is.</li>
      <li><input type="checkbox" data-bz-retained="gtd-051" />Use Friday afternoons or Monday mornings to regroup, reprioritize, and check that your time and energy are heading in the right direction.</li>
      <li><input type="checkbox" data-bz-retained="gtd-052" />Schedule time once a month or quarter to think big and zoom out to make sure your time and energy is focused on what is most important.</li>
      <li><input type="checkbox" data-bz-retained="gtd-053" />Seek feedback and make changes to your systems based on what is working and what is not.</li>

    <p>Having the right personal operating systems in place is key. But how do you know what to prioritize within those systems? Identifying your "Big Rocks" will help.</p>
