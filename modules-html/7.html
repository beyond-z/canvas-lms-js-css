      <figcaption>Former Braven Fellow Kamerie shares why and how she prepares for an interview.<span class="media-duration">1:15</span>
        <div class="transcript">
          <p>Before going to my interview, I made sure that I&rsquo;ve done a bit of research beforehand on the company or organization I am trying to intern for. I also make sure to jot down a few questions I plan to ask the interviewer beforehand. Some of those questions include: What does a typical day in this organization look like for you? And why do you enjoy working here?</p>
          <p>What I stress to dedicate more time to is preparing for the most common questions the interviewers may ask you. And those questions include: What do you know about our organization or company? Why do you want this job? Why should we hire you? And why are you different than the other people we are talking to? By already having answers to the questions they are going to ask you, employers can learn that you are serious, dedicated, and willing to go above and beyond the bare minimum if given the opportunity to be an intern for their company.</p>
          <p>Secondly, I make sure to prepare for the interview mentally. That way I can avoid my mind going blank if I&rsquo;m too nervous. Preparation for me looks like, thinking of examples, experiences, awards and responsibilities I can mention in my interview that I did not have space for or to elaborate on in my resume. All in all, my goal is to avoid regurgitating what is already in my resume, but to instead give life to that piece of paper.</p>

        <p class="feedback inline">If she weaved these accomplishments into her overall narrative of why she would be a good fit, that&rsquo;s one thing. But listing out hr GPA and awards just makes her sound full of herself. And those accomplishments are already listed on her resume.</p>

    <h4 class="box-title">ANSWER</h4>
    <p>While "Tell me about yourself" and "Why this job?" are the top two questions, they are actually asking the same thing! At first glance, you might think, well no, those are two distinct questions. One is about me and one is about the job. Read Karen&rsquo;s story to help explain why these questions, asked in an interview, are asking the same thing.</p>

      <p>Karen shook the hand of her interviewer and sat down at the table.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s great to meet you!&rdquo; said Karen.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s great to meet you too,&rdquo; said the interviewer. &ldquo;Now why don&rsquo;t you tell me a little bit about yourself.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Karen paused, trying to hide her confusion. What did the interviewer want to know? There were so many things about herself she could tell&hellip;</p>
      &ldquo;Well, sure!&rdquo; Karen began. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m originally from Los Angeles. I have two brothers and a sister. My father died when I was little, so I barely remember him. I moved here for college, and while I planned to move back to LA after college, I recently decided to stay so I could move in with my boyfriend. So I&rsquo;m now looking for
      <p>opportunities in this area that will help me grow professionally.&rdquo;</p>

    <h4 class="box-title">ANSWER</h4>
    <p>Karen made the rookie mistake of answering the question &ldquo;Tell me about yourself&rdquo; with an unfocused story about her personal life. Interviewers love to ask this question at the beginning of interviews to see if you&rsquo;re able to focus when responding to such an unstructured question.</p>
    <p>The secret to success is to respond like you would respond to the question, &ldquo;Why this job?&rdquo; You want to explain why you&rsquo;re a good fit for this role at this company.</p>

          <p>Ever since I was a child and experienced my mother battling cancer, I&rsquo;ve been fascinated by the pharmaceutical industry, specifically oncological drugs. I&rsquo;ve spent my college career studying biomedical engineering to learn more about the processes that go into creating medications. I interned last summer at a pharmaceutical company, BioFirst, where I helped conduct clinical trials on a new cancer treatment. I also serve as the Vice President of our school&rsquo;s Biomedical Engineering Club, planning events and workshops of interest to our members.</p>
          <p>Throughout these experiences, I&rsquo;ve learned that my real strength is my attention to detail. I&rsquo;m able to stay organized and juggle multiple tasks at the same time, ensuring everything I commit to gets done on time.</p>

          <p>I&rsquo;m a really good listener and problem-solver. Whenever I say I will get something done, I do it efficiently and effectively. You can ask my professors and former employers: I have never been late on an assignment or a task. And I take pride in that!</p>
          <p>I&rsquo;m hoping to put these skills into good use at your company. I can help take your team from good to great! There&rsquo;s nothing I love more than putting my strengths to good use.</p>

          <p>These experiences growing up are why I&rsquo;m now pursuing a career in hospitality. I hope to manage a hotel one day so that I can create the same kind of feeling of &lsquo;home&rsquo; for guests when they are away from their actual homes.</p>

        <q>"Last summer, I worked at a clothing store. One morning I came into work and realized that something had gone terribly wrong with the closing shift the night before because the store hadn&rsquo;t been cleaned up at all. I looked at my watch and it was only a half hour before the store opened. My colleagues began panicking and getting angry at the employees who closed the night before. I quickly realized we didn&rsquo;t have time to figure out what had happened, but instead, we needed to get to work cleaning up the store. I began delegating tasks, asking one colleague to re-rack clothing, one to sweep the floors, and another to refold shirts in the front of the store. I also got to work organizing clothes in the back of the store. With our combined efforts, we were able to open the store on time with only a few tasks left for the first hour of the store being open, which happened to be our slowest time anyway. When my manager learned about how I had managed the team and stayed calm under pressure in a sticky situation, she promoted me to Floor Manager."</q></li>

    <h4 class="box-title">Stories are more convincing than Facts</h4>
    <p>Answering questions with stories is more compelling, memorable, and believable. Your responses to interview questions are really just stories, at the end of the day.</p>
    <p>There are two storytelling frameworks you can use when answering interview questions: <span class="bz-has-tooltip" title="Situation, Your role, Results, Challenges, Learnings">SYRCL</span> and <span class="bz-has-tooltip" title="Problem, Actions, Results">PAR</span>. The point of using a framework is to keep your stories focused. The last thing you want to do is ramble on and never get to the point.</p>
  </div>
  <h4>Using SYRCL</h4>
  <div>
    <p>The first storytelling framework is called SYRCL (pronounced <em>circle</em>). Use this framework to answer behavioral questions, which aim to learn how you operate, learn, and deal with adversity. Some examples of these questions might be:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><q>What is a recent accomplishment you are proud of and why?</q></li>
      <li><q>When have you worked with a team and failed?</q></li>
      <li><q>How would you work with a teammate who isn't producing great work? How do you motivate someone who doesn't have the skills, ability, or motivations that you have?</q></li>
      <li><q>What would people say about your leadership style?</q></li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="bz-box question">
    <h5 class="box-title">Quick Question</h5>
    <p>Here&rsquo;s an example of a candidate&rsquo;s SYRCL response to the question:<br />
      <q>&ldquo;How would you work with a teammate who isn&rsquo;t producing great work?"</q></p>
    <p>Read the response and then identify the situation, the student&rsquo;s role, the result, the challenges, and what the student learned.</p>
    <div class="bz-example">
      <p>Last semester, I worked on a group project in my anthropology class where I was paired with two other classmates. We were required to choose a neighborhood, conduct fieldwork, and present an ethnography to the class. At the beginning of the project, our team split up the work evenly. However, my teammate who was in charge of creating the presentation slides waited until the last minute to complete his part, and the presentation left much to be desired in terms of professionalism. I knew our grade depended on this presentation, but I also didn't want to discount my teammate's work or redo the entire presentation. So I asked him if we could meet, and we worked together, slide by slide, to improve the presentation.</p>
      <p>Because of our work, we ended up delivering an excellent presentation and received an A on the project. It was definitely a challenge to ensure my teammate felt valued when we were improving the presentation, but I tried to be empathetic and present it as a learning experience for both of us, and I think he appreciated that. I realized that I believe in the power of teamwork and that my authentic leadership shines as a patient, empathetic team player.</p>

    <p>You&rsquo;ll undoubtedly be asked in interviews about times you&rsquo;ve failed, when you faced challenges, and about your greatest weaknesses. What the interviewer really wants to know is what you do in the face of adversity and what lessons you&rsquo;ve learned.</p>
    <p>To answer these kinds of questions, you can use the PAR framework (Problems, Actions, Results), just like Jerold did.</p>

    <p>In this module we&hellip;</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Discussed why you can&rsquo;t excel at interviewing unless you know what&rsquo;s expected of you and prepare</li>
      <li>Looked at some research tools you could use and how each of them might help you</li>
      <li>Practiced answering the top question(s) in most interviews: Tell me about yourself/Why this job?</li>
      <li>Drafted a couple of answers to other common questions using two useful frameworks for telling a compelling story (<span class="bz-has-tooltip" title="Situation, Your role, Results, Challenges, Learnings">SYRCL</span> and <span class="bz-has-tooltip" title="Problem, Actions, Results">PAR</span>)</li>
      <li>Practiced coming up with some good questions to ask back</li>
      <li>And finally we optimized your application documents (resume and cover letter) a bit more, to get you in the habit of constantly tweaking them to fit different opportunities</li>
    </ul>
