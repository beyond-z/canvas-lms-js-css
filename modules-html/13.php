    <p>Let's travel into the future. It’s the Capstone Presentations Learning Lab, and you’re sitting in the audience as another cohort is presenting. It’s clear that the Fellows in this cohort haven’t prepared or practiced their presentation.</p>
    <p>They’re reading from notes and off the slides, which are crowded with text and hard to read from where you’re sitting. They keep interrupting each other because no one knows what part they’re in charge of presenting. You can barely hear some of the Fellows because they’re facing the screen instead of the audience, and they’re not projecting their voices. And you’re just not following what their design solution is because the presentation has no organization.</p>

      <li>Interact using names. For example, "Thank you for your question, Ms. Lucas..."</li>
      <li>If presenting as a team, determine who will answer what kinds of questions, to avoid stepping over each other in real time, and to ensure not just one person answers all the questions.

      <li>Respect your audience by keeping it short and simple. If someone seems to be "attacking" you, disagree respectfully: "That's an interesting point. I've thought about that too but reached a different conclusion..." or "Thank you for that thought. I have a different view of this..."</li>

  <h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap-up</h2>
  <div>
    <p>In this module we looked at two important career skills: giving effective oral presentations and preparing great slide decks to support those.</p>
    <p>We shared dozens of success secrets on how to apply these best practices:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Focus</li>
        <li>Organize</li>
        <li>Be selective</li>
        <li>Empathize</li>
        <li>Exude confidence</li>
        <li>Tell a story</li>
        <li>Practice</li>
        <li>Use your authentic "voice"</li>
        <li>Create a compelling presentation deck</li>
      </ul>
    <p>While all the advice above is valuable, if there's one thing that will determine your overall success in presenting, it's simply how much practice and feedback you get.</p>
    <p>The upcoming Capstone Presentation should give plenty of opportunities to rehearse and up your game, but you should consider treating every presentation you make as a chance to improve on one or more of these fronts.</p>
    <h3>Next Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>To be prepared for Learning Lab this week, make sure your cohort has completed your prototypes, tested your prototypes with at least <strong>ten</strong> users, and refined your prototypes based on their feedback.</li>
      <li>You will be rehearsing your Capstone Presentation during Learning Lab, so make sure your team has a draft of the presentation (deck and talking points) ready to rehearse.</li>
      <li>On your own, continue working on the <a href="/courses/1/assignments/711">Tackle Career Challenges</a> project. You can complete Part 1: Prototype &amp; Test and continue to work on Parts 2 and 3.</li>
      <li>Check out the agenda for your upcoming Learning Lab (below).</li>
