          <div class="transcript">
            <h6>Pauline</h6>
            <p>Hey guys! My name is Pauline and I was in Braven as a Spring &lsquo;14 Fellow, and I could definitely say that networking played a major role as to where I&rsquo;m at today. </p>
            <br>
            <p>When I graduated this past semester, Braven hooked it up with a bunch of informational interviews and networking opportunities where I got to talk with people from companies like Pandora Radio Station, a bunch of startups, and some nonprofit organizations, things I was interested in. I got to talk with these employees, kind of get a feel as to what their jobs were like and if I was interested in it. </p>
            <br>
            <p>Networking is definitely for me an exciting, thrilling, but also very nerve-y feeling. You just got to do what you got to do, put yourself out there and be yourself because that&rsquo;s the best self. Cheesy but true! Again like I said, I would not be where I am today without networking. Lesley - you probably have met her - she tagged me in a LinkedIn post with a job position for Google, and because she tagged me in it, the person who posted it reach out to me, and now I am at Google as a Staffing Services Associate Recruiting Coordinator. So, don&rsquo;t forget to network! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p> </p>
            <h6>Nhu</h6>
            <p>Hi, my name is Nhu, and I&rsquo;m a Fall 2015 Braven alumna. I&rsquo;m here today to share with you some tips about networking that I learned over the past few years. </p>
            <br>
            <p>Of the four jobs I&rsquo;ve had, three of them I&rsquo;ve had because I knew someone in the organization, or had people introduce me to that person, and after that I realized the power of networking. I highly encourage anyone, especially college students, to get out of your comfort zone and get to meet people, because you never know if one day, they are the one who will be helping you to get closer to your dream job. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <br>
            <p>Although I believed that hard work can get you anywhere, networking helps you get to the place you want to be faster and in a more direct way by introducing you to their professional networks. </p>
            <br>
            <p>Another thing I learned about networking is that it&rsquo;s not about being formal and professional with them all the time. Although you met them at a conference, it&rsquo;s very good to maintain the relationship by getting to know them on a personal level. When you establish a meaningful relationship with someone, they are more likely to help you in the future and remember you when an opportunity comes up. And that is how I got my previous jobs. </p>
            <br>
            <p>That&rsquo;s all I want to say about networking, and I hope you enjoy it! &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <br>
            <h6>Jimy</h6>
            <p>Hello everyone! My name is Jimy, and I&rsquo;m a third year student majoring in Management and Information Systems. </p>
            <br>
            <p>I would like to personally thank the Braven community because I wouldn&rsquo;t be where I am today without the help from you guys. </p>
            <br>
            <p>Just a little bit more background about myself. I&rsquo;m currently a legal data science intern at a startup called Lex Machina. I&rsquo;m also a data analyst intern at a semiconductor company called Applied Materials. And last but not least, I&rsquo;m also a database intern at a nonprofit organization called San Jose Downtown Association. &nbsp;</p>
            <br>
            <p>To me, networking definitely did help me get my first internship, which then led to the other two. In the beginning of spring 2017, Bri, who is the Marketing Director at San Jose Downtown Association, who also happened to be a Braven alumna, was invited as a keynote speaker. During that time, she also mentioned something about a database intern, so I decided to just give it a try and see what happened, and here I am today. Without the help from Bri, I feel like I would not have gotten that internship, because -- especially nowadays -- things are very competitive. </p>
            <br>
            <p>My opinion about networking definitely did change, in that I feel more obligated to connect with others, because it can be beneficial for me in the long run. I still keep in touch with my Leadership Coach and my mentor from Braven because the power of networking is super important. </p>
            <br>
            <p>If you guys have any more questions, shoot me an email at <a href="mailto:jimy.ry@sjsu.edu">jimy.ry@sjsu.edu</a>. Thank you. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <br>
            <h6>Jalil</h6>
            <p>Hey guys! My name is Jalil Ahmad, and I was a Fall 2015 Braven Fellow, and today I&rsquo;d like to tell you a story about how networking actually helped me land an internship at Google. </p>
            <br>
            <p>So, towards the end of the Braven Accelerator Course, I actually applied for the Google internship, and I would later find out that I actually wasn&rsquo;t accepted, but being that it was my junior year and I knew how crucial it was to have an internship, I ended up applying for an internship with Teach for America that I actually found out about through Braven. This internship didn&rsquo;t exactly align with what I wanted to do, but because Braven has such close ties with Teach for America, I decided to kind of leverage that connection and apply for the internship and just make the best of the opportunity. </p>
            <br>
            <p>Fast forward to the summer. I actually ended up getting the internship and really, really enjoying it. So upon my last day of work, my manager asked me and the other intern why we had decided to take the internship. I mentioned to her how I had initially applied for Google, didn&rsquo;t get in, and then learned about the Teach for America internship through Braven. When I mentioned Google, she said, &lsquo;Oh wow, I didn&rsquo;t know you were interested in Google. You should talk to my boyfriend. He&rsquo;s the head of the interns program at Google.&rsquo; She was able to get us connected and this ended up being a crucial component to me getting the internship.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I think from this story, two main lessons come out of it. The first is that networking doesn&rsquo;t have to be something that takes place in an intimidating setting like a job fair or something like that. You can end up getting a really critical connection through a simple conversation. And two, continue networking even when you&rsquo;re in an internship or you&rsquo;re at your job because you never know who other people know. Good luck!</p>

  <p>Networking is how you find a job, but it's something you do all the time, not only when you're looking for a job. And for some jobs it's actually part of the job: sales, fundraising, recruiting, research.</p>

		<p>Networking is a probabilities game. While you can't predict exactly where that new opportunity will come from, you will certainly improve your odds by expanding and diversifying your network.</p>
    <p>While you could try to count on blind luck to randomly meet the right people, you can do it a lot faster through networking events.</p>

  	<h5 class="box-title">Some ideas that work</h5>
    <h6>THE CLASSICS</h6>
    <p class="tbd">ADD IMAGES FROM RESOURCE PAGE</p>
    <p>They're classics for a reason &mdash; they always work.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><q>Hi, I don't know too many people here, so I wanted to introduce myself. I'm [name] and I work at [company] / study at [school].</q></li>
      <li>Hi, mind if I join you?<q> I'm [name] and I work at [company] / study at [school].</q></li>
      <li><q>So, what do you do?</q></li>
      <li><q>So, what brought you here today?</q></li>
    </ul>
    <h6>Basic things you have in common</h6>
    <p>No matter what, you've got at least a couple things in common with every person in the room:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><q>How did you hear about this event?</q></li>
      <li><q>What a beautiful venue. Have you been here before?</q></li>
      <li><q>How are you enjoying this event so far?</q></li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h6>THE NEWSWORTHY</h6>
    <p>This is another thing you have in common with just about everyone. Try to avoid veering into politics unless that's your industry.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><q>What do you think about [topic related to the event]?</q></li>
      <li><q>Any chance you read the news today? I missed it, and I'm curious what's going on with [topic].</q></li>
      <li><q>Did you catch the game last night?</q> (only ask this if you can actually talk about sports!)</li>
    </ul>
    <h6>GREAT FOR INTROVERTS</h6>
    <p>If you&rsquo;re an introvert, walking into a room full of unknown people can feel extra intimidating. One of our favorite approaches is to look toward the outskirts of the room and find someone who looks a little lonely. Maybe that person sitting alone doesn&rsquo;t know anyone and is just hoping that someone will come talk to them. Be that person, and try one of these lines.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><q>Man, these networking events can be so crazy. Mind if I join you over here where it&rsquo;s a little quieter? I&rsquo;m [name], by the way.</q></li>
      <li><q>Since we're both here at the [buffet, bar, same table], I feel I should introduce myself. I'm [name].</q></li>
      <li><q>I&rsquo;m feeling pretty overwhelmed by the deluge of info that&rsquo;s being firehosed at us today. Is there one nugget of brilliance that&rsquo;s really resonating with you?</q></li>
    </ul>
    <h6>THE TOTALLY RANDOM</h6>
    <p>If all else fails, consider one of these:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><q>Any chance you know a great [sushi /Mexican / burger &hellip; ] place around here?</q></li>
      <li><q>If there is one question you do not want me to ask you, because you are sick and tired of answering it, what question would that be?</q></li>.3
      <li><q>I'm new to this. How do you usually start a conversation with someone you haven't met before?</q></li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="bz-box question">
    <h5 class="box-title">Quick Question</h5>
    <p>When you introduce yourself you're likely to experience a surge of adrenaline. That's totally normal, but it also means <strong>you will have a hard time taking in the other person's name</strong>.</p>
    <p>Which of following is <strong>not</strong> a trick used by professionals to remember their conversation partner's name?</p>
    <ul class="radio-list">
      <li class="incorrect"><input type="radio" name="networking-mnemonic" data-bz-retained="networking-mnemonic" value="option1" />Repeat it a few times: "Nice to meet you, Sally" and later "so, Sally, what do you do?" and "it was great to meet you, Sally"</li>
      <li class="incorrect"><input type="radio" name="networking-mnemonic" data-bz-retained="networking-mnemonic" value="option2" />Ask them to repeat it: "I'm sorry I didn't catch your name, could you please repeat it?"</li>
      <li class="incorrect"><input type="radio" name="networking-mnemonic" data-bz-retained="networking-mnemonic" value="option3" />Think about someone famous or another word that sounds similar and try to mentally connect it with the person's face. For example, if you meet someone named John and he wears glasses, you might think of John Lennon of the Beatles.</li>

  </div>
  <div class="bz-box answer">
  	<h5 class="box-title">Answer</h5>
    <p>Remembering someone's name isn't really about memory, but about focusing your attention on that person. Most people can become very good at remembering names with just a bit of practice of techiques like the ones listed in the question above (except the selfie, though).</p>
  </div>
  <h4>What to talk about</h4>
  <h5>The other person</h5>
  <p>If there's one thing people can always talk about, it's themselves. Make things easy for yourself by asking them questions and then following up with more questions about things you find interesting. Remember you're talking to a human being, so try to be authentic and don't fake interest (it will show). If you feel the conversation isn't flowing very well, consider wrapping it up (see below).</p>
  <h5>Yourself</h5>
<p>Sometimes the other person will ask you one of the classic questions: "So, What Do You Do? / Tell Me About Yourself / What Brings You Here?" Sometimes you won't be asked, but will still need to communicate quickly who you are and your interests.</p>
    <p>That's the perfect time to launch into your <em>elevator pitch</em>: an extremely short introduction to help the other person know who you are and what you're interested in. It has to be so short that you could effectively present yourself (and/or your project/organization) on a short elevator ride, hence the term Elevator Pitch.</p>

  <div class="bz-box answer">
  	<h5 class="box-title">Answer</h5>
    <p>Stephaine is a very strong pitcher, and does a good job leading the conversation without going too far. What Brandon likely takes away from this is that Stephanie is a person who takes initiative, has energy and focus, and demonstrates good communication skills (she's concise and clear).</p>
    <p>Such traits and skills are highly valued in almost any job, and are hard to fully demonstrate in a resume or job application.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="bz-box action">
  	<h5 class="box-title">Take a small but real step</h5>
  	<p>Use the template below to create a rough draft for a pitch. You'll try it out during Learning Lab and keep improving it through the Accelerator and beyond.</p>
    <p>You'll also need to adjust your pitch based on who you're talking to and what you want to achieve. Pick an arbitrary person and context for this exercise and make your first draft:</p>
		<h6>1. THE OPENING</h6>
    <p>Start with a greeting and a <span class="bz-has-tooltip" title="Firm but not bone crushing; palms alinged (i.e. no one is grabbing at fingers); make eye contact once grip is established.">great handshake.</span></p>
    <blockquote>
    	<p>Hello, my name is&nbsp;<input type="text" data-bz-retained="pitch-name" />&nbsp;and I am a student at&nbsp;<input type="text" data-bz-retained="pitch-college" />&nbsp;majoring in <input type="text" data-bz-retained="pitch-major" />.</p>
		</blockquote>
    <h6>2. WHO YOU ARE AND WHAT YOU WANT TO DO</h6>
		<p>It's best to tell this as a story with a cause and effect. For example you can tell them how your classes led you to realize you have a passion for a particular subject or skill. Don&rsquo;t go into too much detail, but be sure to demonstrate your deep interest or passion for your intended career field. Employers want to know you care about what you do.</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>I'm interested pursuing a career in <input type="text" data-bz-retained="pitch-career" />. In school I <input type="text" data-bz-retained="pitch-experience" placeholder="studied X / was a member of X / led a project for X" />, which has taught me a lot about&nbsp;<input type="text" data-bz-retained="pitch-learned" />.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h6>3. WHY THEY SHOULD CARE</h6>
    <p>Make a list of skills and strengths you&rsquo;ve developed from previous experiences and think about how they relate to what you want to do. Then, pick the most relevant ones to work into your elevator pitch. </p>
    <p>Once again a telling a true story about cause and effect (I did X, <em>therefore</em> I learned Y) will be much more powerful than dry facts (I did X and also learned Y).</p>
    <p class="tip"><strong>Tip:</strong> Even if you&rsquo;ve only had jobs or internships in an unrelated field, think about your duties and accomplishments and find ways to relate them to what you want to do. For example serious sports experience can exemplify your ability to commit and persist, work in teams, and handle high expectations and pressure.</p>
    <blockquote>
			<p>This past summer I <input type="text" data-bz-retained="pitch-interned" placeholder="interened at... participated in... worked on... " />, which was a great experience because I learned/practiced <input type="text" data-bz-retained="pitch-skill" />.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<h6>4. FROM PAST TO PRESENT TO FUTURE</h6>
    <p>Now that they know what you've done so far it's time to state your future intentions (internship/job related), and why you think the company (or industry) is a good fit for you. 
    <blockquote>
    	<p>I intend to go into <input class="bz-optional-magic-field" type="text" data-bz-retained="pitch-go-into" /> when I graduate in <input class="bz-optional-magic-field" type="text" data-bz-retained="pitch-grad-years" /> years,</p>
			<p><strong>AND/OR:</strong></p>
	    <p>I intend to pursue an internship in <input class="bz-optional-magic-field" type="text" data-bz-retained="pitch-pursue" placehoder="field/industry or speciality" />&nbsp;for next summer.</p>
      <p><br /><br />I'm particularly interested in <input type="text" data-bz-retained="pitch-company-industry" placeholder="[company, field, or industry]"/> because <input type="text" data-bz-retained="pitch-reason-fit" placeholder="[your reasons]" />.</p>
    </blockquote>
 		<h6>5. THE ASK</h6>
    Now it's time to make a specific <em class="bz-has-tooltip" title="A request">ask</em>. You might feel uncomfortable asking for something, but it's a way to signal that you want to start a relationship with them. For example you can ask them for ideas on where they think you could best apply your skills.
    </p>
    <p>If you&rsquo;re talking about a specific job, don&rsquo;t be afraid to ask if you can send them your resume for the role. If you&rsquo;re not discussing a specific job, ask for an informational interview about that field or organization.</p>
    <p>Let's look at a possible ask:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>Could we speak for 15 minutes over the phone regarding <span data-bz-retained="pitch-company-industry">your company and the industry</span>? What are some times that work for you?</p>
		</blockquote>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="tip">Go over and tweak your pitch draft one more time and when you're ready let's move on to practicing it.</p>

  <h3>Beyond networking events: targeting specific people for informational interviews</h3>
  <div>
  	<p>Let's say you are looking for a job at a specific company. You'd want to talk to people on different teams; or you might want to talk to a specific person who has a unique perspective on the industry/company you're interested in, e.g. because they worked at several different companies.</p>
    <p>This kind of conversation is called an <span class="bz-has-tooltip" title="a brief informal conversation (15-30 minutes) with someone working in your area of interest who will give you information and advice" >informational interview</span>.</p>
    <p>Luckily, there's a tool to help you find the right people to ask for an informational interview, called LinkedIn.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="bz-box action">
  	<h4 class="box-title">Take a few quick real life steps right now</h4>
  	<p>Follow these steps and check them off as you complete them:</p>
    <ul class="checklist dont-mix">
    	<li><input type="checkbox" data-bz-retained="networking-linkedin-checklist-0" />Log into your LinkedIn account and go to <strong>edit your public profile</strong>: <em>top navigation bar</em> &rarr; <em>Me</em> &rarr; <em>View profile</em> &rarr; <em>Edit your public profile</em> (right hand corner menu). Resist the urge to do other stuff like checking your notifications; just follow this list.</li>
    	<li><input type="checkbox" data-bz-retained="networking-linkedin-checklist-1" /><p><strong>Make your profile easier to find:</strong> When you first make your LinkedIn profile page, the URL that LinkedIn assigns to your profile will not be a pretty one:</p><p><code><small>http://linkedin.com/pub/firstname-lastname435564-hjfjrigjht</small></code></p><p>As a result, a web search by a potential employer might not turn up your profile, leaving them less confident in your professional credentials, or worse, looking at another person with the same name who is less accomplished than yourself.</p>
      <p>On the right hand side of your public profile settings click the little pencil icon next to the address box under <em>Edit public profile URL</em>. Try deleting all the extra numbers and letters. If you have a common name, you might have to modify it further. Try deleting the space between your first and last name, replacing it with an underscore or period, or adding a middle initial.</p></li>
    	<li><input type="checkbox" data-bz-retained="networking-linkedin-checklist-2" /><p><strong>Get 14 times more views by adding a profile photo</strong>: You had your professional headshot taken during the Storytelling as Leadership Workshop. Now put it to good use. A professional photo for LinkedIn should be high resolution, have a clean background, and be from the shoulders up. A photo with a smile shows your energy and enthusiasm!</p></li>
    	<li><input type="checkbox" data-bz-retained="networking-linkedin-checklist-3" /><p><strong>Write a headline that stands out</strong>: By default, LinkedIn populates your headline with your job title and current company, but you don't have to leave it that way. Consider listing your specialty and speaking directly to your audience. To improve the searchability of your profile, include important keywords. Try to keep your headline to about 10 words max.</p></li>
    	<li><input type="checkbox" data-bz-retained="networking-linkedin-checklist-4" /><p><strong>Hide your activity, but make your profile public</strong>: A non-public profile will hinder employers and recruiters who are trying to research you. But you also don't want people to see every time you make a change to your profile. Head to your privacy settings and turn off your activity broadcasts to prevent edits to your profile from appearing in LinkedIn's feed of updates (<em>top navigation bar</em> &rarr; <em>Me</em> &rarr; <em>Settings and Privacy</em> &rarr; <em>Privacy tab</em> &rarr; <em>Sharing profile edits</em>).</p></li>
    	<li><input type="checkbox" data-bz-retained="networking-linkedin-checklist-5" /><p><strong>Write a strong summary</strong>: Your LinkedIn summary is one of the most valuable pieces of real estate you have to showcase your authentic and impressive self. It's the place where you get to be more personal than, say, on your resume or in a job application. <a href="/courses/1/pages/write-a-strong-linkedin-summary-statement" target="_blank">See this resource</a> on how to write a strong LinkedIn summary</p></li>
    	<li><input type="checkbox" data-bz-retained="networking-linkedin-checklist-6" /><p><strong>Flesh out your experience section</strong>: Take your resume online and take the time to list the significant positions that have helped you build your career. This is also the place to put all the interesting stuff that doesn't fit on your resume, but paints you as a well rounded individual.</p>
</li>
    	<li><input type="checkbox" data-bz-retained="networking-linkedin-checklist-7" /><p><strong>List your experience in the Braven Accelerator</strong>: This is a great opportunity to show people the skills you built, what you've accomplished, and your commitment to continuous learning. <a href="https://portal.bebraven.org/courses/25/files/8467/download?wrap=1" class="tbd">Read this short doc</a> for content to include in your LinkedIn profile about Braven</p></li>
    	<li><input type="checkbox" data-bz-retained="networking-linkedin-checklist-8" /><p><strong>Add your volunteer experiences:</strong> 42% of hiring managers surveyed by LinkedIn said they view volunteer experience as equivalent to formal work experience. Moreover, if your volunteer experience directly pertains to your job search, put it in as work history, so it's up in the relevant section, not down at the bottom.</p></li>
    	<li><input type="checkbox" data-bz-retained="networking-linkedin-checklist-9" /><p><strong>Get 13 times more views by listing your skills and collect endorsements</strong>: Tell employers what you can do and give your connections the chance to endorse you for each skill by listing your skills in a shorthand way. Include at least 5 skills relevant to your career interests. You can reorder skills to place more important ones at the top.</p></li>
    	<li><input type="checkbox" data-bz-retained="networking-linkedin-checklist-10" /><p><strong>Get recommendations</strong>: Endorsements for your skills are great, but recommendations have even higher currency. In the Recommendations section of your profile click <em>Ask to be recommended</em> to reach out via LinkedIn to your current or former managers, colleagues, or associates to write something glowing about you. It's OK to offer to write a draft of the recommendation yourself and then invite the person to vet and post it.</p></li>
    	<li><input type="checkbox" data-bz-retained="networking-linkedin-checklist-11" /><p><strong>Get 5 times more views by joining groups and being active</strong>: Join groups related to your area of expertise, industry, school, passions, social causes, and other aspects of your identity. Try to select groups that are highly active and have a lot of members. Get started by joining <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/groups/7020311" target="_blank">Braven's national LinkedIn group</a>!</p></li>
    	<li><input type="checkbox" data-bz-retained="networking-linkedin-checklist-12" /><p><strong>Get connected</strong>: LinkedIn makes it very easy to connect with others. Add members of your cohort, your Leadership Coach, and Braven staff that you've interacted with. Add volunteers you've met at Braven events. Consider adding connections to your contacts from Gmail, Hotmail, Outlook, Yahoo! Mail or any other e-mail list you have.</p></li>

      <p>Dear Naomi:</p>
      <p>It was great to run into you last week at the Food Bank fundraiser on campus. I was happy to see they were successful at reaching their fundraising goal.</p>
      <p>I was hoping you could introduce me to your friend Jason Zee, as I see you're connected on LinkedIn. I am looking for a job in his field, and I'd like to talk to him about his experience.</p>

      <p>Hi Professor Wong,</p>
      <p>I hope all is well! My name is Prateek Kulkarni, and I'm a student in your 9am chemistry lab on Thursdays. I'm a sophomore, and I'm majoring in chemical engineering.</p>
      <p>I know how important it is to immerse myself in a real, relevant work experience before I graduate. For that reason, I'm trying to expand my network in the biomedical field and secure an internship this summer. I noticed on LinkedIn that you're connected to Dr. Karen Miller, the Chief Medical Officer at BioLink. I would love to speak with Dr. Miller to learn more about her experience working in the field for 15+ years and better understand my own potential career path.</p>
      <p>Would you be willing to introduce me to Dr. Miller? If so, I can send over a brief paragraph about myself and my interests as well as my resume that you can include in your email to her.</p>
      <p>Thanks in advance, and I look forward to hearing back.</p>
      <p>Best,</p>
      <p>Prateek</p>

    <p>It's not necessary to reach out to each of your networking connections every month, but you also shouldn't let them grow too cold. If they can't remember who you are, you can't really consider them your connections.</p>
    <p>Reaching out can range from a quick email saying "Just wondering how you've been" to a meeting over coffee or lunch.</p>
    <p>If you can't think of a proactive reason to reach out, use a tracker to remind you they exist. See the following Productivity Corner for some ideas.</p>

	<p>Thankfully, there are a lot of tools out there that can help you manage your network so that you don't make this kind of mistake. Here are three to consider:</p>
  <h3>Use a networking spreadsheet</h3>
  <div>
    <h6>Have a page for each company</h6>
    <p>This will help to keep each company isolated, and it will tip you off easily to companies that you have been ignoring.</p>
    <h6>Keep track of the following</h6>
    <ul class="dont-mix">
      <li>The person's name</li>
      <li>Their job title</li>
      <li>Date of each contact</li>
      <li>Brief notes of each contact (e.g. what you asked of them)</li>
      <li>Date of planned follow-up</li>
      <li>Did you follow up</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When following up try giving them <em>specific</em> appreciation. It goes a long way because it shows you were paying attention. Something as simple as, "I especially enjoyed hearing your thoughts about the culture in the Denver plant" shows that you genuinely valued their time.</p>
    <h6>Track next steps</h6>
    <p>Make sure you are building your network intentionally and know your next steps with each contact &mdash; or at least each prioritized contact.</p>
  </div>
  <h3>Set calendar reminders to follow up</h3>
  <p>Aside from putting in the times of your upcoming informational interviews, it would be a smart idea to schedule reminders to follow-up with quality contacts.</p>
  <p>Maybe you are still a year away from applying and you don't want to wear out a contact. In this case, set a reminder three months from now to ask them to speak with you about a different topic. As you speak with more people, you will begin to develop more advanced questions that matter to you, so coming up with additional topics of discussion should be very doable.</p>  
  <h3>Use an app</h3>
  <p>A <span class="bz-has-tooltip" title="Customer/Contact Relationship Management">CRM</span> app such as <a href="http://www.boomeranggmail.com/" target="_blank">Boomerang for Gmail</a> can help you track follow-ups and even schedule emails to be sent when it's time to follow up with one of your contacts.</p>
  <p>Here's an example of how Boomerang works:</p>
  <iframe class="full" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XU1iRwqJC1U?rel=0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

  <div>
    <p>In this module we did <em>a lot</em> of things:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>We explored why networking is critical to your career (85% jobs are filled through networking)</li>
      <li>We looked at what networking is (building authentic relationships) and what it isn't (smarmy self-promotion)</li>
      <li>We covered some best practices for meeting new people (especially at events), making conversation, and explaining what you're interested in (your elevator pitch)</li>
      <li>You took some steps to optimize your LinkedIn profile and do some real life online networking</li>
      <li>We got you set up for successful informational interviews</li>
