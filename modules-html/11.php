    $transcript = '<p>Hi, my name is Katy, and I’m currently a Store Planner at Old Navy. Both in my current role and in my past experiences as a manager, I’ve had to facilitate a number of meetings at work, both ad hoc project management style meetings as well as business reviews that happen week over week. Through my experiences, there are a few things I would offer you as you begin your experience facilitating meetings at work as well.</p><p>The first thing is I would be sure you have a clear, established purpose for the desired outcomes you want to achieve through this meeting. In addition to that, you want to establish an agenda for the meeting that will directly lead the group to those outcomes you’ve stated.</p><p>Also, [and] that leads me to the second point, to just make sure that agenda and that purpose are clearly communicated to all participants ahead of the meeting date. This will ensure all participants know what’s coming, have prepared their role appropriately, and are showing up ready to engage and have a robust discussion and eventually lead you toward success in achieving your outcomes.</p><p>Additionally it’s very important at meetings at work to make sure that meetings stay on time and on task. It can be a challenge as a lot of good ideas surface, people are excited to participate, but it isn’t uncommon for side conversations to begin, or rabbit holes that start getting run down that can detract from the purpose of your meeting. Often times, establishing language to be able to validate those points and to be able to revisit them offline at another time is an effective way to help keep your meeting on time and on task.</p><p>Also, too, as you get towards the end of your meeting, it’s important to make sure you provide the group a summary of key points that have been discussed, decisions that have been made, ultimately goals that have been reached, and if there is any outstanding or follow up work, that next steps are established, and everyone who is present understands they have a role in completing those next steps too.</p><p>So, with that I’ll leave you with one last nugget, is that [if] after all of this great preparation, you&rsquo;ve determined that this topic could actually be resolved with a conversation or two or an email exchange, go ahead and do that. It’s really great to be known at work as when you do hold a meeting and you take everyone’s valuable time, that you have a really clear purpose, and you’re known for getting things done in meetings.</p><p>Best of luck to you as you go forth and start facilitating meetings on your own.</p>';

    array('You&rsquo;re able to envision how the meeting will play out in your head.','Practice “Image Training.” Just as athletes run through the race or game in their mind in advance, preparing their bodies’ neural pathways for the real thing, facilitators should close their eyes and mentally walk through the session. Try to visualize difficult situations that might crop up and how to handle them calmly, rehearse jokes or stories, or simply imagine the group smiling. When it comes time to execute the facilitation, the mind is ready.','That is a great skill to have. Keep it sharp!'),
    array('You clarify the expected outcomes or objectives of the meeting and stay focused on them.','Create an agenda (see more detail in the Productivity Corner at the end of this module) where you list out the expected outcomes or objectives of the meeting. Build the rest of your agenda, including activities and discussion topics, around achieving these outcomes. Whenever you feel conversation going down a rabbit hole or slipping away from the objectives, refocus the conversation by saying something like, “It seems like we’re losing focus. Let’s get back to discussing XYZ.”', 'Staying focused on objectives is the number one secret to successful meetings.'),
    array('You intuitively know when the group&rsquo;s energy is low and energize the group throughout the meeting.','You know what boredom looks like, so force yourself to notice when people are losing focus. You can also set a norm at the beginning of your meeting that people should feel empowered to voice when they feel their energy dropping.</p><p>When energy is low, change it up! Try a brief energizer like jumping jacks or stretching. Ask everyone to stand, move to a different part of the room, sit on the floor, or go outside. It’s worth making these small adjustments to ensure everyone can stay engaged.','A sensitive radar for other people&rsquo;s emotional state is almost like a super-power. Use your empathy for good! :)'),
    array('You manage participation, ensuring everyone&rsquo;s voice is heard.','How much each participant chooses to talk will vary, as will their communication style. Draw out the quieter participants by asking pairs or small groups to discuss questions first or requesting their opinion once other people have talked a bit. Allocate different roles to the people you feel might be hogging too much attention, such as a note taker, timekeeper, or scribe on the board. Ensure small group work has a balance of participants with different communication styles.','This habit not only ensures fairness, it fosters creativity and team motivation!'),
    array('You adapt your facilitation style based on the needs of the group.','Sometimes your group will need a more directive facilitation style. This means you will tell the group what they should be doing. Other times, often once the group knows each other well, a more consultative facilitation style can be effective. This means that participants voice what they think is needed and discussion flows based on these needs.  '),
    array('You take a step back and let the other members of the group carry the discussion.','Facilitators only need to activate the group, and then take a step back. Facilitators can ask questions, point to people who deserve their turn at answering, and then let the group members carry the discussion. If a facilitator speaks the whole time, it will defeat the purpose of the meeting, which is to collaborate with a group of people.','That&rsquo;s good facilitation. Just make sure the conversation doesn&rsquo;t veer from the meeting&rsquo;s objective!'),
    array('You pace yourself so that you get to every objective.','On your agenda, indicate how much time you estimate each activity or discussion will take. Then during the meeting, set a timer on your phone or ask another participant to keep time throughout. If you feel focus slipping, remind the team about your time constraints.','You&rsquo;ve mastered a rare skill. Just remember not to be so strict with timing that you stifle a good productive conversation prematurely.'),

  <p>In order to successfully facilitate Learning Lab during the Capstone Challenge, and as part of your Tackle Career Challenges Project, you’ll have to create a meeting agenda. If you’re facilitating next week, it’s a good idea to do that now!</p>

  <div>
    <p>In this module we looked at how to effectively facilitate meetings, since you'll be having meetings to work on your project and, naturally, in almost any job in the future.</p>
    <p>We asked you to self-evaluate your facilitation skills and looked at some tips based on where you need to grow (we suggest you scroll up and revisit those as soon as you're done here).</p>
    <p>We also looked at some meeting agendas (and if you're facilitating this week, you get to practice using the one below).</p>
    <h3>Next Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Complete <a href="/courses/1/assignments/711">Tackle Career Challenges Project</a>, Part 1: Empathy-Based Research</li>
      <li>Conduct empathy-based research for the Capstone Challenge (interview 3+ users)</li>
      <li>Make sure your team's Project Manager has finalized the project plan and shared it with the rest of your cohort</li>
      <li>Check out the agenda for your upcoming Learning Lab (below). Even if you're not facilitating, read through this section so you know what to expect in Learning Lab.</li>
