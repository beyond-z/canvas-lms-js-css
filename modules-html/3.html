    <h4 class="box-title">Answer</h4>
    <p>According to a recent BCG survey<a class="ref-source" href="https://www.bcgperspectives.com/content/articles/human_resources_leadership_decoding_global_talent/?chapter=5#chapter5">#</a> these are the top five factors that made Americans most satisfied at work:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Working for a financially stable company</li>
      <li>Having a good relationship with your manager</li>
      <li>Good work-life balance</li>
      <li>Good fit between company values and personal values</li>
      <li>Being appreciated for your work</li>
    </ol>
  </div>
  <p>Looking at the survey results above, you'll notice that people who are happiest at work have jobs that align with their needs and with what they're good at; in other words, they are living their <em>hustle</em>.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

One says head, the other says heart, and the intersection is labeled hustle." data-api-endpoint="https://portal.bebraven.org/api/v1/courses/1/files/11520" data-api-returntype="File" /></figure>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Your hustle is the result of your heart &ndash; your values, passions, interests &ndash; and head &ndash; your strengths and talents, what you know &ndash; working in line with each other. You know that feeling when you are in the zone, losing track of time? If you can find work (for enough money) that makes you feel this way, that's your hustle.</p>

    <h3 class="box-title">Answer</h3>
    <p>According to a Gallop survey<a class="ref-source instructure_file_link" title="Gallup Survey in PDF" href="/courses/1/files/11519/download?wrap=1" data-api-endpoint="https://portal.bebraven.org/api/v1/courses/1/files/11519" data-api-returntype="File">1</a>, only 30% of Americans are engaged at work. That means most Americans are either indifferent or unhappy with what they are doing with the majority of their time. But does it have to be this way?</p>

    <p>Create a vision board representing your interests and passions (not just professional/academic). You can do this digitally by using a service like <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/" target="_blank">Pinterest</a>, a slide deck etc. Or you can do it the traditional way, by cutting and pasting clippings from magazines or your own artwork, if you prefer.</p>
    <p>It doesn't have to be very pretty, so don't go overboard making it perfect! Ten minutes should be more than enough to make a basic board.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <div class="bz-inset">
      <p class="tip" style="text-align: left;"><strong>Tip:&nbsp;</strong>You're probably tempted at this point to&nbsp;put this task off for later. We suggest you take a short break instead&nbsp;and get refreshed, but then come back and quickly get it done and move on to finish the module. You don't have much more to go!</p>
    </div>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>When you're done, paste a link to your vision board (or to a high quality image of it) here:</p>
    <input type="url" data-bz-share-release="" data-bz-retained="vision-board" />
    <div class="share-release">
      <input checked="checked" type="checkbox" data-bz-retained="vision-board-share-release" />

  <div class="bz-box answer">
    <h5 class="box-title">Good job!</h5>
    <p>Being highly aware of your values and interests will make you happier at work when your values and passions align with the job you're doing. It will also help you narrow down career/job choices based on shared company/organization values and interests.</p>

  <h3>How to identify your strengths (your head)</h3>
  <p>Now that you've explored your heart, it's time to uncover what's in your head - your unique strengths and skills.</p>
  <div class="bz-box action">
    <h4 class="box-title">Get to Know Yourself</h4>
    <p>There are many ways to uncover your strengths. For example, as part of your <a href="/courses/1/assignments/704" target="_blank" data-api-endpoint="https://portal.bebraven.org/api/v1/courses/1/assignments/704" data-api-returntype="Assignment">Design Your Career project</a> you'll be asking people who know you for stories that highlight your strengths. Another option is to take personality tests (such as <a href="https://www.strengthstest.com/" target="_blank">Strengths Finder</a> or <a href="http://www.myersbriggs.org/" target="_blank">Myers Briggs</a>, which are also popular with recruiters).</p>
    <p>One of the most comprehensive tests is the <a href="http://www.viacharacter.org/" target="_blank">VIA Character Strengths Assessment</a>. Take the test now (requires registration, and takes about 20 minutes) and when you're done, paste your top five strengths in here:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <input type="text" data-bz-retained="strengths-01" />
      </li>
      <li>
        <input type="text" data-bz-retained="strengths-02" />
      </li>
      <li>
        <input type="text" data-bz-retained="strengths-03" />
      </li>
      <li>
        <input type="text" data-bz-retained="strengths-04" />
      </li>
      <li>
        <input type="text" data-bz-retained="strengths-05" />
      </li>
    </ol>
    <input class="bz-toggle-all-next" type="button" value="Done" data-bz-retained="unlock-btn-6" />
  </div>
  <div class="bz-box reflection">
    <h5 class="box-title">Reflect</h5>
    <p>Did any of the strengths surprise you? If so, which ones?</p>
    <textarea class="bz-optional-magic-field" data-bz-retained="strengths-r1"></textarea>
    <p>What are some times that you exemplified these strengths?</p>
    <textarea data-bz-retained="strengths-r2"></textarea>
  </div>
  <div class="bz-box question">
    <h4 class="box-title">Quick Question</h4>
    <p>You may have noticed that most of the strengths in the VIA test focus on interpersonal relations and character traits, as opposed to skills, knowledge, or specific talents. Why are those important to your career choice?</p>
    <ul id="via-reasons" class="checklist" data-bz-max-score="3">
      <li class="correct">
        <input type="checkbox" value="1" data-bz-retained="unlock-201" />
        Employers sometimes use these tests to sort through job candidates, and it's useful to know what they'll be seeing about me</li>
      <li class="correct">
        <input type="checkbox" value="1" data-bz-retained="unlock-202" />
        It always helps to know yourself</li>
      <li class="correct">
        <input type="checkbox" value="1" data-bz-retained="unlock-203" />
        Some careers or jobs have more room to apply certain strengths than others, and knowing what those are can help me find a good fit.</li>
    </ul>
    <input class="for-checklist bz-toggle-all-next" type="button" value="Done" data-bz-retained="unlock-btn-7" />
  </div>
  <div class="bz-box answer">
    <h4 class="box-title">Answer</h4>
    <p>All of the above are correct. When you encounter similar tests in the future it's usually helpful to try them out (but also keep in mind they're not all scientific, so take the results with a grain of salt).</p>

  <h3>How to Define Your Hustle</h3>
  <p>You'll be doing more work to define your hustle during this week's Learning Lab. The following should give you a great head start.</p>
  <div class="bz-box video">

    </figure>
    <div class="transcript">
      <p>Hey guys, it's Edgardo here from Braven, and I'm here to talk to you a little bit about my hustle. So, when I was in college, my dream career was to work managing public relations within the entertainment industry, and I was fortunate enough during my first job to land a role working at Nickelodeon. At first, I loved my job. I got to go to fun events and I was able to meet some celebrities and I also found myself starting to get really good at managing relationships, solving problems and thinking through them, as well as coming up with solution to day-to-day operations and so forth. One day I was working on this campaign and I learned about something called the achievement gap, which showed that people of color often from low-income backgrounds tend to perform on standardized tests at a much lower level than some of their peers. Not even that, that often, they would start two steps behind everyone else, so for me, at that moment, my heart plummeted because something that I saw growing up was not only a problem in my community, but was playing itself out nationwide.</p>
      <p>So, I started volunteering because I wanted to do somethingabout the problem. I felt that at my role at work I was not able to make the kind of impact that I was hoping to make. After a couple of years of volunteering as a mentor, I started seeing my mentee make a lot of progress. And I started realizing that all the things I was good at in my full-time job &mdash; that I could actually bring them into a different field and help solve a problem that I was really passionate about and that really pulled on my heart strings.</p>
      <p>After some time, I realized that I had a different career that was a calling for me. And that's when I really discovered my hustle &mdash; when I was able to bring together something I really cared about along with something I was passionate about. Now I focus on managing nonprofit programs so that students from all backgrounds have access to strong outcomes in their careers and education.</p>
