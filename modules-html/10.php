          <h6>1. Teams establish psychological safety.&nbsp;</h6>
          <p>Psychological safety - or the shared belief that the team is safe for interpersonal risk taking - was far and away the most important of the five dynamics Google&nbsp;found.&nbsp;It sounds simple, but establishing an environment where teammates feel safe to&nbsp;ask&nbsp;questions, give suggestions, or share open and honest feedback&nbsp;requires work.&nbsp;Individuals on teams with higher psychological safety are more likely to harness the power of diverse ideas from their teammates and operate twice as&nbsp;effectively as other teams.</p>

          <p>When team members get things done on time and meet a shared&nbsp;high bar of excellence, teams will operate more effectively.&nbsp;It takes an average of six weeks to gel as a team, and&nbsp;as soon as members&nbsp;become&nbsp;lax with their demanding responsibilities, the entire team suffers.</p>

          <h6>5. Team members communicate frequently.&nbsp;</h6>
          <p>On a typical team,&nbsp;a dozen or so communication exchanges per working week&nbsp;may turn out to be optimum. It's also critical that teams&nbsp;spend&nbsp;time communicating outside of formal meetings, as increasing opportunities for informal communication tends to increase team performance. However, it's critical that team members talk and listen with equal measure. Lower performing teams have dominant members, teams within teams, and members who talk or listen but don&rsquo;t do both.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>On website launch day, the team realized the site had some bugs making it not work properly. Someone had dropped the ball on making sure the website had been tested. Everyone started to feel nervous about the implications of this error. </p>
      <p>The team got together for an emergency meeting to discuss what happened and what to do next. Becca spoke first, admitting her fault for not doing the appropriate tests on the website, and apologizing to the team. Daniel spoke next, saying it was also his fault as the Project Manager that he wasn’t clearer up front about what tests needed to be done. Becca asked for help from Sheila, a senior web developer, to see if they could make the bug fixes they needed to today. Sheila agreed to help.</p>

    <p>In this module we looked at why teamwork skills matter for your career success:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You will most likely work in teams no matter what job you have </li>
      <li>Employers hire for good teammates </li>
      <li>Being a good team player is more important to the success of a team project than your individual talents </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Then we went through some frameworks and tips you can apply to build a strong team around you, such as:
    <ul>
      <li>Identifying where your team is on the continuum: forming &rArr; storming &rArr; norming &rArr; performing</li>
      <li>Being aware of common pitfalls and handling common dysfunctions</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We also used the Leadership Compass framework to help you become more aware of your leadership style and what your strengths are as a team member.</p>
    <p>And finally, we reviewed the upcoming challenges you'll take on as a team and individually, and boosted your project planning skills a bit to get you ready for capstone kick-off.</p>
    <p><strong>Good luck kicking-off your project at the next Learning Lab!</strong></p>
