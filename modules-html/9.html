    <h3 class="box-title">Quick Question</h3>
    <p>It&rsquo;s your first month on the job and you are confronted with a big, hairy problem to solve. You feel that this is your time to shine (or fail). Which of the following is true? (check all that apply)</p>
    <ul class="checklist instant-feedback">
      <li class="correct"><input type="checkbox" data-bz-retained="dts-q01-1" />You're more likely to identify the best solution and act on it by not leaving things up to chance.</li>
      <li class="correct"><input type="checkbox" data-bz-retained="dts-q01-2" />Using a <span class="bz-has-tooltip" title="Methodical, using a plan">systematic</span> approach will lead to solutions that are less subjective and less impacted by biases or perceptions.</li>
      <li class="correct"><input type="checkbox" data-bz-retained="dts-q01-3" />You will find it easier to present your solution to the rest of the team if it's backed by a clear rationale.</li>
      <li class="incorrect"><input type="checkbox" data-bz-retained="dts-q01-4" />You will have to rely on luck to figure things out.</li>
      <li class="incorrect"><input type="checkbox" data-bz-retained="dts-q01-5" />You will use a process of elimination and try all sorts of things that don&rsquo;t work.</li>

  <p>You may already know some approaches to systematic problem solving, and even if you don&rsquo;t, you may have some good problem-solving instincts. This module will walk you through an approach you may not be as familiar with &mdash; Design Thinking &mdash; which can help you solve some of the big, hairy problems you&rsquo;ll probably encounter in work and in life.</p>
  <div class="bz-box question empathize">
    <h3 class="box-title">See it from their perspective</h3>
    <p>You&rsquo;re interviewing a candidate for a role at your company. You want to know how he approaches problems, because problem-solving is a daily task at your workplace. You present the candidate with a typical problem you encounter at your company, and ask how he would approach it. What do you hope to hear?</p>
    <ul class="radio-list instant-feedback">
      <li class="correct"><input name="dts-q-03-r" type="radio" value="1" data-bz-retained="dts-q-03-r" />A description of the logical, step-by-step framework he would follow to solve the problem
        <p class="feedback inline">Correct! You want to see how he wraps his head around problems and that he approaches them systematically.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="incorrect"><input name="dts-q-03-r" type="radio" value="2" data-bz-retained="dts-q-03-r" />He won&rsquo;t sleep until he solves the problem
        <p class="feedback inline">You want to know that he will work smart, not just work hard. Being well-rested is important for solving problems well!</p>
      </li>
      <li class="incorrect"><input name="dts-q-03-r" type="radio" value="3" data-bz-retained="dts-q-03-r" />He will ask the appropriate person at the company for help
        <p class="feedback inline">You want to know how he would try to solve the problem before asking for help. Asking for help isn&rsquo;t a bad thing, but if he&rsquo;s always reliant on others to solve problems for him, he won&rsquo;t be an asset to the team.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="incorrect"><input name="dts-q-03-r" type="radio" value="4" data-bz-retained="dts-q-03-r" />A list of all the possible solutions
        <p class="feedback inline">This might make you think he jumps to conclusions without any process, which could mean he a) will make a lot of mistakes, and b) will waste a lot of time until he finds the right solution (if he ever does).</p>

        <p class="feedback inline">Effective problem-solvers believe there is a solution for almost every problem and they believe in their capacity to create positive change. They believe in their own ability to find solutions.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="correct"><input type="checkbox" data-bz-retained="dts-q05-2" />Positive attitude
        <p class="feedback inline">Effective problem-solvers value optimism and not giving up. They embrace a sense of possibility and curiosity when confronted with problems. They celebrate the journey and value the learning process which can sometimes involve being wrong or making mistakes. Their sense of self-worth isn't dependent on the solutions they land on.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="correct"><input type="checkbox" data-bz-retained="dts-q05-3" />Critical thinking skills
        <p class="feedback inline">Problem-solving draws on critical thinking and your ability to use knowledge, facts, and data to effectively solve problems. This does not mean you need to have immediate answers but it does mean you have methods to think on your feet, assess problems, and find solutions.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="correct"><input type="checkbox" data-bz-retained="dts-q05-4" />Creativity

      <li class="correct"><input type="checkbox" data-bz-retained="dts-q05-5" />Adaptability
        <p class="feedback inline">Effective problem-solvers are flexible in their approach to finding a solution. They embrace the iterative process: They solicit input, act on feedback, consider new information and ultimately land on a better solution that way. They can also change their approach based on the type of situation they are faced with.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="incorrect"><input type="checkbox" data-bz-retained="dts-q05-6" />Self-sufficiency
        <p class="feedback inline">While problem-solving will require autonomy, it cannot be done all alone. Seeking feedback and other voices along the way will result in a better solution.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="incorrect"><input type="checkbox" data-bz-retained="dts-q05-7" />Sticking to one framework
        <p class="feedback inline">Effective problem-solvers leverage a variety of techniques to define problems and identify solutions.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="incorrect"><input type="checkbox" data-bz-retained="dts-q05-8" />Having all the answers
        <p class="feedback inline">No one has all the answers, and keeping an open mind during the process of defining and solving a problem is likely to generate better solutions.</p>

  </div>
  <p>In addition to solving human-centered problems, Design Thinking is a great approach for tackling complex, persistent problems that are difficult to frame because it asks us to spend more time listening to users and defining the problem than building solutions. We stay away from &ldquo;jumping to conclusions&rdquo; too quickly because if we don&rsquo;t adequately understand the problem, we might build an unnecessary solution that doesn&rsquo;t work or that no one uses.</p>

    <p>Empathy is the foundation of the human-centered design process.</p>
    <p>You need to understand the people whose problems you're trying to solve (typically defined as "<em>users</em>" of a product, service, or system), in order to build a solution they can use. And you must build empathy for who they are and what&rsquo;s important to them. Effective Design Thinking takes you, your ideas, your tastes, and your assumptions out of this important first step and puts the user at the center of your curiosity and innovation.</p>

    <p>To empathize means to know what users are saying, doing, thinking, and feeling, and most importantly: understanding why.</p>
    <p>An empathy map can help you organize the information you gather about your users. The deeper you go, the more likely you will get to the root problem, and be able to build a solution that solves it effectively.</p>
    <p>Let's take the man who has been waiting for three hours in the hospital waiting room video. Let's imagine that his name is Martin and he is waiting for his wife to complete hip replacement surgery &mdash; a complicated, long, and risky procedure. Fill out this empathy map for Martin:</p>

For example, perhaps you go into a coffee shop and there's a long line of customers ahead of you. You might assume the problem is that the baristas are working too slowly. However, if you were to conduct empathy-based research with the other customers in line and the baristas, you would discover the actual root problem, which is that the coffee shop on the next block is closed with a pipe leak, and so all of their usual customers came to this coffee shop today, making the line extraordinarily long.</p></li>

    <h5 class="box-title">Finding the root problem/need</h5>
    <p>A ladder, a book, or a longer arm are all nouns that suggest we already know the solution. A need always starts with a verb and stems from what you found out from your users during empathy research.</p>
    <p>But a verb is not enough. If you're going to spend time solving a problem, you had better make sure you're solving a root problem, not a superficial one (e.g. cure the disease, not just alleviate the symptoms). To get to the deeper need you can use the <strong>Five Whys</strong> framework:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Find the "presenting" problem, for example: 
        <p><em>The girl can't reach the book</em></p></li>
      <li>Ask yourself "why is this a problem?" once:
        <p><em>Because the girl needs to read what's in the book</em></li>
      <li>Repeat about five more times:
        <p>Because she needs to prepare for an English test &rArr;<br />
        Because she needs to get an A on her English test<br />
        Because she needs high grades to get into a good high school<br />
        Because she needs to get into a good college on a scholarship<br />
        Etc...
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>You'll notice it's not always the deepest problem that makes the most sense to solve (the scope of the problem usually expands as you go deeper), but the Five Whys will ensure you're not stuck on the surface.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="bz-box">
    <h6>SURPRISING INSIGHT</h6>
    <p>This describes what you've learned about the user and his/her need.</p>
    <p>Insights combine observation with intuition. It should be surprising, not trivial. And it should not be the same as the need. If the insight is not surprising, seek something bigger or more challenging to help inspire innovative solutions.&nbsp;</p>

    <h5 class="box-title">How to brainstorm like a pro</h5>
    <p>Here is the general procedure for brainstorming:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Pick one "how might we" question to start with.</li>
      <li>Invest energy in a short period of time, like 15 to 30 minutes of high engagement, or rapid five-minute bursts.</li>
      <li>Capture ideas by selecting a scribe to record ALL ideas for all to see, or have each person write down and share his/her ideas as they come up.</li>
      <li>Shoot for as many ideas as you can in a limited amount of time. For example, aim for 50 ideas in 20 minutes. In brainstorming, quantity matters more than quality, and this is a way to force your team to focus on quantity.</li>
      <li>When idea generation slows down, move to another round of brainstorming by considering another "how might we" or adding a constraint. Constraints usually start with "What if..." and create boundaries, which leads to more ideas you might not have thought of otherwise.</li>

    <p>What is <strong>NOT</strong> true about refining your prototype?</p>

      <li class="correct"><input name="dts-q41-r" type="radio" value="1" data-bz-retained="dts-q41-r" /> Refine is the last step in the Design Thinking process.
        <p class="feedback inline">Correct. Refine is not necessarily the last step in the Design Thinking process, since it may take you back to redefining the problem or testing another version of your prototype.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="incorrect"><input name="dts-q41-r" type="radio" value="2" data-bz-retained="dts-q41-r" /> You need to refine your prototype - and possibly over and over - to get a solid working solution.
        <p class="feedback inline">This is true about refining your prototype.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="incorrect"><input name="dts-q41-r" type="radio" value="3" data-bz-retained="dts-q41-r" /> Refine is the step in the Design Thinking process where you take what you learned from testing and from user feedback and improve upon your solution.

    <h5 class="box-title">Let's give refining a quick try</h5>
    <div class="bz-example">In the testing phase, we got feedback back from Martin that he didn't necessarily need a large stretching area or an exercise ball or a foam roller. He said that it would be sufficient to have a wall with enough space to stand and do some standing stretches. Hanging a poster about stretches would be helpful to indicate to people that it was a stretching area, so people wouldn't wonder what he was doing. But the suggested stretches illustrated on the poster would have to be pretty universal and easy to understand. And while back stretches would help him, it wouldn't meet everyone's needs so we might want to provide a variety of stretches, or just leave it to users to look up stretches on their smartphones.</div>
    <p>Based on Martin&rsquo;s feedback, what would you do next?</p>

  <div class="bz-box answer">
    <h5 class="box-title">Some possible next steps are:</h5>
    <ol>
      <li>Ditch the more elaborate prototypes. This is good news because it would be less expensive to execute a simpler solution.</li>
      <li>Develop the initial prototype of a stretching wall by getting into the details: specify the location and amount of space needed, visual cues to direct attention to the wall, design of the instructional poster, what stretches the poster would include, how other proposed activities might be communicated, etc.</li>
      <li>Then have Martin experience the wall again!</li>

    <p>In this module we looked at problem-solving, a skill that's highly valued in the workplace. Then we explored a specific problem-solving framework called Design Thinking, which is optimized for coming up with ideas for new or improved products, services, and experiences.</p>
    <p>Then we went over the six steps of the Design Thinking process:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Empathize</strong> &mdash; We went over why you have to get a good sense of who the user(s) are and what their current experience is. You can use an Empathy Map to explore what they're thinking, feeling, doing, and saying. We also looked at what kinds of questions work best to mine users for helpful insights on the problems they're facing:
        <ul>
          <li>Open-ended</li>
          <li>Non-biased</li>
          <li>Aiming to uncover needs/wants/frustrations</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Define</strong> &mdash; We saw that the <em>presenting problem</em> ("I have a headache") is hardly ever the <em>root problem</em> ("My vision is blurry, which strains my eyes, which causes headaches"). Getting the problem definition right is a must for actually coming up with an effective solution (prescription glasses) rather than a superficial fix (painkillers). We practiced using the Problem Statement template ("[<em>User</em>] needs a way to [<em>user need</em>] because&nbsp;unexpectedly, in his/her world, [<em>surprising insight</em>]") to help focus your work and lead to promising How Might We (HMW) questions.</li>
      <li><strong>Ideate</strong> &mdash; We looked at the brainstorming method of ideation and listed some best practices to get the most out of it:
        <ul>
          <li>Defer judgment</li>
          <li>Go for quantity</li>
          <li>One conversation at a time</li>
          <li>Headline (jot down just a few words or a picture to capture the idea)</li>
          <li>Build on the ideas of others</li>
          <li>Stay on topic</li>
          <li>Encourage wild ideas</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We also considered several methods to narrow down the list of ideas once you're done brainstorming:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Vote (each team member "stars" about three favorite ideas)</li>
          <li>Merge and Extract (combine ideas that can work together, find overarching themes)</li>
          <li>Sort by quality and feasibility (and make sure to keep wild ideas in the running)</li>
          <li>Sort by medium/tools</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Prototype</strong> &mdash; We looked at the most important practices in prototyping:
        <ul>
          <li>Use it to "fail early" &mdash; to quickly see what works and what doesn't</li>
          <li>Make something people can interact with or at least visualize</li>
          <li>Use any medium or tools that get&nbsp;you "quick and dirty" prototypes you can test and evaluate</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Test</strong> &mdash; We looked at why we test and how to do it (create a protocol, collect data, reflect to understand).</li>
      <li><strong>Refine</strong> &mdash; We took a quick look at what refining looks like, and noted that it's not always the end of the process, but could lead to redefining the problem or building new prototypes for testing.</li>
    </ol>
