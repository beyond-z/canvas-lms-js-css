    <h3 class="box-title">Answer</h3>
    <p><strong>16.7%</strong>. People of color are represented at significantly lower rates in the Executives category than in the Professionals category of the tech sector, where they comprise 32% of the workforce (compared to 38.4% of the total population). Here is a breakdown:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>African Americans: 2%</li>
      <li>Hispanic / Latinx: 3.1%</li>
      <li>Asian Americans: 10.6%</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The rate is very similar for board seats at <span class="bz-has-tooltip" title="500 U.S. corpotations with the highest revenues as of last year">Fortune 500 companies</span>. 85.6% of those were held by White people in 2016 (compared with 77% White / 61.6% non-Hispanic White in the U.S. general population)</p>

      <figcaption>Betsy, a software engineer in the Bay Area, shares the top three things that make it challenging to bring her true self to work on a day-to-day basis.<span class="media-duration">2:24</span>
        <div class="transcript">
          <p>Hi everyone! My name is Betsy, and I'm currently a software engineer working in Oakland right now.</p>
          <p>Some of the challenges I face in regard to bringing my true self to work have to do with: mentorship, feeling like I'm being heard, as well as advocating, kind of standing up for myself.</p>
          <p>So first, I think mentorship is a huge one. It's pretty hard to find mentors who share similar experiences or kind of, just like look like you, especially for me as a woman of color working as an engineer. Most of the people on our team and in the grand scheme of things are white men and so sometimes it's hard to share experiences that mightbe really vulnerable with them, or for them to really understand or give you advice on experiences that are happening to you. So sometimes you have to look for that outside your organization rather than get the technical mentorship within.</p>
          <p>Second, I think the two other ones are more feeling like you're being heard and also standing up for yourself, which kind of go hand in hand. So feeling like you're heard: as a woman, and also as a minority, racial and ethnic minority, sometimes I find myself saying things and people don't really listen, and it isn't until a counterpart who is a man or is a white man repeats it, and people are like, oh that makes so much sense. And I'm like, wait, I just said that! That happens quite often, on a day-to-day basis. And then advocating for yourself is really the latter or the other half of that, which is learning when to say, I did the work, I need to take credit, or I need to talk to my manager, and ask for something harder because I feel I'm getting things, tasks that are way too easy for me. And knowing how to do it and when to do it, which kind of loops back to finding good mentors who you can kind of ask that advice for.</p>
          <p>Yeah, so I think those are the top three challenges although there's some other challenges that you face as someone who is a minority in the space that you're working in.</p>

    <p>In the workplace, your performance and success are judged based on expectations by others (peers, managers, professors, etc.), and their expectations are always affected to some degree by cultural biases and <span class="bz-has-tooltip" title="A stereotype is a commonly held yet oversimplified idea about a type of person">stereotypes</span> about your perceived identity.</p>
    <p>When you feel at risk of confirming negative stereotypes about your perceived social group, that's called a <strong>stereotype threat</strong>.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  </div>
  <h3>How to understand Stereotype Threat</h3>
  <p>The problem of stereotype threat is real and it is not with you &mdash; it's with stereotypes (systemic). Let's look at some examples of stereotype threat:</p>

      <figcaption>A simple change in the description of a test in school changed how different groups performed, due to stereotype threat.<span class="media-duration">About 3 minutes</span></figcaption>
    </figure>
  </div>
  <p>The risk of stereotype threat is not just a feeling; it can actually make you perform worse than you're capable of. That can happen either because you are taking mental energy away from the task at hand, or because you've internalized the stereotype, either consciously or subconsciously.</p>

  <p>You could probably think of many other times you've experienced stereotype threat in your life up until now. But what about what lies ahead as you navigate your career? You guessed right: you will also experience stereotype threat in the workplace.</p>
  <p>Coping productively with stereotype threat starts with being able to identify when it's happening.</p>

    <h4 class="box-title">The takeaway</h4>
    <p>As you can see, even though these coping methods are common reactions to stereotype threat, they're not optimal.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="bz-box read">
    <h4 class="box-title">The Four Secrets to Coping Better</h4>
    <p>The following four stories offer strategies to help you combat stereotype threat in a more positive way. They are all taken from Claude M. Steele's book <em>Whistling Vivaldi</em>.</p>
    <h5>1. Growth Mindset</h5>
    <blockquote class="vignette">
      <p>[&hellip;] The question that [Stanford researchers] Joshua, Carrie, and Catherine asked was whether the impact of stereotype threat could be reduced by giving students a narrative of intelligence as more expandable. Such narrative would frame academic frustration as a fixable problem rather than as an unfixable limitation, thus reducing the risk involved in confirming the stereotype.</p>
      <p>They devised a clever way to do this: they asked black and white Stanford students to write letters to ostensible minority elementary school students in East Palo Alto, California, advocating an expandable view of human intelligence. They were given information documenting the expandability of human intelligence; information on the nature of learning, on how the brain changes to reflect learning and experience, and evidence of people making great strides in building intellectual skills. And, of course, writing the letter gave them a chance to thoroughly process this narrative. For white Stanford students, not negatively stereotyped in this area, writing the letter had no effect on their subsequent grades. For black Stanford students, however, living under the suspicion of negative ability stereotypes, this changed narrative increased their grades by one-third of a letter grade in the next semester.</p>
      <p>Sometimes you can give people facing identity threat information that enables a more accurate and hopeful personal narrative about their setting. When this is possible, these intriguing experiments show, it improves the academic achievement of people in real colleges: it can put their achievement on very different trajectories.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h5>2. Having an effective mentor</h5>
    <p>More specifically: having a mentor you can trust, who holds you to high expectations, and who believes you can meet them.</p>
    <blockquote class="vignette">
      <p>[&hellip;] I was assigned Thomas Ostrom as my faculty adviser, whose job it was to help me develop into a scientist through a research apprenticeship. [&hellip;] From the vantage point of a new graduate student, he seemed mostly like a priest of scientific rigor. When we talked about research in his office, he often lit a fat white candle positioned prominently on his desk&mdash;and smiled hopefully.</p>
      <p>Recall that, at the time, my personality was in full lockdown [due to stereotype threat]. especially at school. I did like meeting with Tom, though. He was calm, serious, and nice, but not that personal &mdash; which, to someone in personality lockdown, was rather welcome. He didn't seem worried about my paralysis. Maybe he didn't know what to do about it, or maybe he didn't even notice it. He didn't seem to focus on me. Rather, in the candlelight, it was the research that got his attention. It would be years before I got any direct praise from him, but his interest in what we were doing together was intense from the beginning.</p>
      <p>I took a message from this: he had faith in me as a worthy partner. Somehow his assumptions about what he was doing as a scientist included me as, at least potentially, a capable colleague. My race and class identities didn't get in his way. If he'd given we praise, I might not have trusted it &mdash; so vigilant to threat was I. But I could trust this calm working relationship. My paralysis began to thaw. I teased him about playing the banjo. He pleaded with me that bluegrass music was really great and that I should give it a chance &mdash; knowing, beneath his wink, that for a kid from Chicago, this wasn't likely to happen. We laughed. My motivation intensified. I became as interested in the research as he. Tom liked that. We'd found an adhesive surface.</p>
      <p>As this relationship came together, the same cues that had bothered me before &mdash; the constant references to who was "smart," the near-complete absence of minorities in the program or in the field, the faculty member down the hall who used the "N" word in class, the evidence that I was of a culture different from that which dominated the setting &mdash; bothered me less. I didn't like those things. But they didn't mean I couldn't fit into the field. At the level of the science itself, people could take my work at face value. My adviser did.</p>
      <p>Tom had no knowledge of stereotype threat, or much knowledge of African American experience, for that matter. That wasn't the basis of our rapport, which rested, rather, on a straightforward, nice, but work-focused relationship [&hellip;] It changed the meaning of other cues in the situation.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h5>3. Self-affirming narrative</h5>
    <blockquote class="vignette">
      <p>[&hellip;] Close to the beginning of the school year, [the researchers] asked teachers to give each student in their classroom an envelope with his or her name on it. Instructions in the envelope asked half of the students, randomly selected, to write down their two or three most important values (for example, family relationships, friendships, being good at music, or their religion) and then write a brief paragraph about why these values were important to them &mdash; that is, to put these value statements in the form of a personal narrative. This took only about fifteen minutes. When they were done, they put the material back in the envelope and handed it to the teacher. In later school terms, they did a few similar follow-up writing exercises. That was it.</p>
      <p>The other students in these classrooms &mdash; the control group &mdash; did the same thing, except their instructions asked them to write down their least important values and to explain why others might find them important. These students got a chance to think about values, but no chance to affirm any self-narrative about them. Could the brief self affirmation affect school performance?</p>
      <p>It did &mdash; dramatically so. The affirmation exercise improved the grades of all but the strongest black students over their performance in the first three weeks of school, before they did the affirmation. And those with the poorest early performance improved the most. They did better in the class where they made the affirmation and in their other classes too. Other measures showed that the affirmation even reduced how much they thought about the racial stereotypes over the entire semester.</p>
      <p>The results for the black students in the control condition &mdash; those who did no value affirmation &mdash; helped reveal what the affirmation did to reduce the gap. It stopped a slide in grades that otherwise would have happened. The grades of the no-affirmation control students kept going down, making the racial achievement gap in these classrooms ever wider over the school term.</p>
      <p>What the affirmation did for the black students who performed it was to stop or slow this decline. In so doing, it reduced the gap with white students by 40 percent over the term. Just as amazing, follow-up research showed their higher achievement, and that smaller gap with white students, lasted for at least two years.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h5>4. Embracing your identity</h5>
    <blockquote class="vignette">
      <p>[&hellip;] Still, we Americans are wary about focusing on identity. Could whatever gain it yields outweigh the divisiveness it might cause? Hasn't our use of race, for example, been one of our society's greatest shames? This is a big part of why we so want Obama's election to have marked the beginning of a postracial era &ndash; to put that shame behind us. It is perhaps ironic, then, in light of these hopes, that while Obama himself called for Americans of all identities to come together to build an era of progress, he didn't call for a postracial society or interpret his election as a sign that such a society had arrived. To the contrary, he stressed his racial and other identities, openly embraced them, wrote books about how important they were for him to understand and incorporate into his sense of self. He hungered for a strong, developed racial identity. Here he is in his own words on March 18, 2008, during his famous Philadelphia "race speech" in the heat of his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination:</p>
      <blockquote>I am a son of a black man born Kenya and a white woman from Kansas. I was raised with the help of a white grandfather who survived a Depression to serve in Patton's Army during World War II, and a white grandmother who worked on a bomber assembly line at Fort Leavenworth while be was overseas. I've gone to some of the best schools in America and lived in one of the world's poorest nations. I am married to a black American who carries within her the blood of slaves and slaveowners &mdash; an inheritance we pass on to our two precious daughters. I have brothers, sisters, nieces, nephews, uncles and cousins, of every race and every hue, scattered across three continents, and for as long as I live, I will never forget that in no other country on Earth is my story even possible.</blockquote>
      <p>In this passage Obama is not hiding his racial identities but embracing them, not advocating a color-blind or postracial society but pointing to the many colors that make up this society and himself. He is putting identity and his multiple identities forward, using them as a bridge.</p>
      <p>In a society leery of identity, this could seem counterintuitive. Indeed, his staff advised him against this speech. Still. it may have gone farther than anything else he did to make nonblack Americans comfortable with him as a candidate and, eventually, as a president. It established a common ground between Obama and a huge swath of the American electorate. We all have identities, often many of them. And despite important differences between identities, a lot of the experience of having one identity is Ike the experience of having another identity. That he talked about his multiple identities enabled people to see this, to see into their own identities and what that understanding could tell them about the identity experiences of others. These stories of his bridged Obama to the multitudes. They enabled people to see themselves in him, a man who, without these stories about his identities, ironically would have been just a black man.</p>
      <p>It also gave people, implicitly at least, a broader understanding of identities &ndash; that they are not rooted in unalterable essences that control the character of a person all the time. Important as identities are, people could see in Obama's experience that they don't capture or represent the whole person. They could see that identities are fluid, that their influence on us is activated by their situational relevance. It's a truth that many people sense in their own experience, and they apparently appreciated his having affirmed it. From this perspective, identity is less scary, less something to be wary of. In fact, exploring it might be helpful. Clearly Obama gained from exploring his identities; it gave him self awareness and poise, insight and empathy into the circumstances of other people's lives, a connection to a great range of people, and the social competence to get things done. In his example, identity wasn't a source of balkanization and threat; it was a source of wisdom about the challenges of a complex and diverse society that ultimately made him the most suitable person to lead such a society. To the surprise of all, perhaps, it was his stress on identity, not his suppression of it, that made him a symbol of hope. My hope for <em>Whistling Vivaldi</em> is that, in some small may at least, it will help to sustain that hope.</p>

    <p>According to a current leading theory in psychological research, your personality (who you are) is made up of five elements ("<a href="https://www.sesp.northwestern.edu/docs/publications/89090097490a0624369b9.pdf" target="_blank">the New Big Five</a>"):</p>

      <li>Your <strong>biological traits</strong> as a human (e.g. what you look like, things you can/can't physically do)</li>
      <li>Your <strong>dispositional traits</strong> (i.e. your character: extrovert/introvert, risk tolerance, etc.)</li>
      <li>Your <strong>adaptations</strong> (e.g. how you choose to enjoy yourself, how you handle stress, etc.)</li>
      <li>Your self-defining <strong>life narrative</strong> (i.e. how you explain what happens to you and how it connects to your story as you understand it)</li>
      <li>Your <strong>cultural and social context</strong> (what culture(s) you live in, what your role is in your family, community, school, or work, what your relationship status is, whether you have children, how much money you can spend on things, etc.)</li>

    <p>In the workplace &mdash; and life in general &mdash; you will inevitably encounter biases and stereotype threat. It comes with having an identity, and there's not much you can do to change it. You can, however, choose how to cope and respond to this.</p>
    <p>The most common ways people cope include over-achieving, assimilating, hiding, or counter-attacking. But those strategies have serious risks involved. A more productive way to cope and thrive is to lead with your authentic self:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Embrace your identity/-ies</li>
      <li>Find strength in the story of your life. You've made it up to this point, and you can keep going further.</li>
      <li>Find the right mentor(s) &ndash; someone who expects a lot but can also give it to you straight.</li>
      <li>Have a growth mindset: stereotypes cannot define the limits of how far you can go.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Out of the Big Five components of your personality, your story and the role you play in it are yours to define and control (self-defined life narrative).</p>
    <h3>Next Steps:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>In coming weeks you will have the opportunity to work on your narrative through identifying strengths (next week), the Storytelling as Leadership workshop, and the Reflected Best-Self exercise.</li>
