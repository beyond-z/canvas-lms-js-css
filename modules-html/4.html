    <h3 class="box-title">Quick Question</h3>
    <p>You are going on a trip to a far away country where you've never been. The flight ticket to get there cost you a lot, leaving you with limited spending money, and with only three days to visit. Which of the following can you do ahead of the trip to ensure you have the best time possible?</p>
    <ul class="checklist instant-feedback">
      <li class="correct">
        <input type="checkbox" data-bz-retained="path-001" />
        <p>I'll do my research ahead of time (e.g. talk to people, read books, look online)</p>
        <p class="inline feedback"><strong>Yes!</strong> How else would you know what to do there?</p>

      <li class="correct">
        <input type="checkbox" data-bz-retained="path-002" />
        <p>I'll prioritize what I want to see/do there ahead of time</p>
        <p class="inline feedback"><strong>Definitely!</strong> This one is about being <em>effective</em>. Since you only have a limited time there, prioritizing will ensure you spend it on the most valuable things first.</p>

        <p>I'll just trust my luck when I get there.</p>
        <p class="inline feedback"><strong>Probably not.</strong> In some cases you may end up having a lot of fun, but you risk missing out on things that are even more fun (or about as fun but less costly), or worse: ending up somewhere you don't want to be.</p>

    <p>You have limited time, energy, money, and other resources, and you want to make the most of them career-wise.</p>
    <p>You need to research your options, decide what's more important and/or more appealing to you, and come up with a plan to make it all happen.</p>

        <p>Braven team member Tess shares how planning her career while she was still in college has helped her personally, even when the plan had to change. <span class="media-duration">1:29</span></p>
        <div class="transcript">
          <p>Hi Braven Fellows! I'm Tess from the Braven Design Team.</p>
          <p>When I was in college, having a vision and goals for my future career really helped me make the most of my college years. At the time, my career goal was to work in community development at an affordable housing nonprofit. I decided to major in Urban Studies so that my courses aligned with the kind of knowledge and experience I would need in the field. I joined the college newspaper and wrote for the housing beat. I also had three internships at affordable housing organizations throughout college so that I could learn the ropes and get real professional experience. I wrote a college thesis about the New York City housing authority and worked with a thesis advisor who is a professional in the field.</p>
          <p>Having a clear vision and goals for my future career helped me know what opportunities to pursue, and what to say yes and no to.</p>
          <p>However, after graduation, I ended up changing course and pursuing a career in education. And that's okay! I knew my plan was never set in stone. But having a vision, goals, and a plan helped me gain experience in college that has helped me immensely in my career, even to this day.</p>

    <p>That's right, slide decks are used in virtually every profession. They are a great way to communicate information visually and tell stories.</p>
    <p>Often, slide decks are used as complements to <strong>in-person</strong> presentations (you've probably given or received a presentation paired with PowerPoint). But just as often, decks must <strong>stand alone</strong>, because there's no opportunity to give a presentation in person, or people prefer to digest the deck on their own.</p>

    <p>In this module we started the process of coming up with your Career Roadmap:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You defined a vision for yourself (or at least a tentative one)</li>
      <li>From this vision you derived your ten-year career <span class="bz-has-tooltip" title="Specific, Measurable, Ambitious, Reasonable, and Time-Based.">SMART</span> goal.</li>
      <li>We began setting some milestones to mark the way to your big goal</li>
      <li>And we looked at the six most important goals you should plan to achieve by graduation</li>
    </ul>
    <p>And finally, in this week's Productivity Corner, we looked at some tips for making effective stand-alone slide decks.</p>
