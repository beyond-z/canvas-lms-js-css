      <p>It’s the midway point in the Capstone Challenge, so it’s a good time to give and get feedback with your teammates. You’ll have the space in Learning Lab this week for a feedback discussion. </p>

      <p>Hi! I’m Jenni. I’m a Data Science Manager at Instagram, and I’m here to talk to you a little about one of my favorite topics: feedback.</p>
      <p>Feedback, in my opinion, is one of the things that really sets people apart in the workplace. Giving and receiving honest, critical feedback was one of the hardest things for me to learn as a manager and as a teammate. When I first started managing, it was really hard for me to give people honest, critical feedback because, frankly, I thought they were going to think I was mean or that I didn’t like them or that they would take it personally. I was worried. My ego got in the way that people wouldn’t like me if I was giving them critical feedback.</p>
      <p>What I started to realize over time is that I was depriving people on my team and depriving my partners in the workplace of an opportunity to actually get better at their jobs, because if I didn’t point out critical feedback then they would have no way of knowing what they weren’t doing well or what they could improve on. Actually, my giving them feedback was a gift. One of the ways I was able to realize this was starting to give critical feedback and getting really positive signals from people that they really liked this, and also seeing that people were actually doing better at their jobs after I gave them the critical feedback.</p><p>So for me, one lesson that I learned is that giving feedback is a muscle. The more you do it, the easier it gets. I really recommend that all of you start doing this in small ways, and I think you’ll find over time that your capacity to give feedback is continually increasing, and it’s going to pay dividends.</p>

The decision not to let us know what happened is what set us back as team. In the future I think there needs to be more open lines of communication.

        <p>Overall, the team has worked well together, but one person, Isabel, has not been pulling her weight. Last night she even missed an important group meeting, in order to go watch the World Cup with some friends from her dorm. Her unpredictability, having to catch her up, and figuring out what to do when she doesn't do her part has been exhausting for everyone.</p>
        <p>As far as you know, no one has brought this problem up to her yet, and looking over the requirements, you think that all members of the team will need to do their fair share in order for the team to be successful. You have a week left before the project is due. You've reached out to meet with Isabel 1:1 to give her feedback.</p>

      <p>At the end of the day, the goal of your feedback conversation is that the person receiving the feedback generates insights and learns from the conversation. To make this happen, you’ll have to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Listen:</strong> Make room for the other person to share his/her thoughts and feelings and stay actively focused on what the person is saying instead of formulating your response. Listening may involve asking clarifying questions to better understand what the person is saying and paraphrasing to acknowledge what you've heard.</li>
        <li><strong>Be empathetic:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Leave space to acknowledge the discomfort: "I know this is a lot to take in, and I don't want you to feel overwhelmed. How are you feeling about this so far?"</li>
            <li>Open the channels of communication: "Tell me more about how you experienced this situation;" "What are your thoughts on that?"</li>
            <li>Manage your tone, pace, and word choice: "Let's take a moment to process and think"</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Don’t forget strengths:</strong> In fact, lead with them. Empower the person to maximize what s/he does well. Use your assessment of the strengths to make a suggestion on how the individual might address the opportunity.</li>

        <p><strong>Martha:</strong> Great. So before our big event last week, I was in charge of getting everything in place and ready to go. We had set a deadline for a month out for me to get the designs from you. However, I didn’t receive the designs from you until a week before the event, which made my job of executing much more difficult. I ended up scrambling and making some little mistakes, which could have been avoided if I’d had the time to plan properly. I am hoping that in the future, we can stick to the deadlines we set, so that I don’t have to scramble and we can host a great event. </p>
        <p><strong>Tess:</strong> Thank you for that feedback. I really appreciate it. Let me see if I’m completely understanding. So because I was late in getting you the designs for this event, you had a limited amount of time to prepare, and it resulted in un-needed stress and even some errors that could have been avoided. Is that accurate?</p>
        <p><strong>Martha:</strong> Yes, exactly. It was pretty stressful for me!</p> 
        <p><strong>Tess: </strong>I’m so sorry about that. I really had no intention of making your life more difficult! I will do what I need to do to make sure I manage my time better and get you designs by the deadline in the future. </p>
        <p><strong>Martha:</strong> Great, that sounds like a good plan. </p>

    <div>
      <p>In this module we looked at getting and giving feedback, which are two of the most important skills you'll need to learn and grow in any job (and life in general).</p>
      <p>We began by looking at how to give feedback. We emphaized that planning how you'll give feedback (e.g. by formulating it using STAR or "When you did X I felt Y") is an important key to making it work.</p>
      <p>Then we looked at some <em>do</em>s and <em>don't</em>s of receiving feedback, and especially on following through with what you've heard to keep getting better.</p>
      <h3>Next Steps:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Make sure you begin building prototypes with your cohort to stay on track in the <a href="/courses/1/assignments/684">Capstone Challenge</a>.</li>
        <li>For the <a href="/courses/1/assignments/711">Tackle Career Challenges</a> Project, complete <i>Part 1: Define the Problem</i> and get started on Parts 2 and 3.</li>
        <li>Check out the agenda for your upcoming Learning Lab (below)</li>
