To compile on the Admin Server, run this first: source ~/dlang/dmd-2.087.1/activate
Note: the Admin Server has libssl-dev v1.0 but the actual editor server has libssl-dev 1.1 (or newer). If you want to compile directly on the Admin Server, you have to remove the following libe from the Makefile:
   -version=older_openssl \

Note: if the arsd submodule gets updated and we need to pull in changes, you have to switch to that directory and run `git pull origin master` manually.
