Do not delete or modify any files in here directly! You may break everything
because the editor uses the whole chain of files in here to reconstruct your
edit history - and it replays the edit history to build the most recent version
of the file.

Also, do not try to add files to this directory yourself. Use the buttons
in the editor and let it manage all this.
